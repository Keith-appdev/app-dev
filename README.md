# Deadpool and Deadpool2
I really love the **comedy** that the two movie series offer
as well as **Ryan Reynolds** acting that brought forth the character
of deadpool very accurately from the comics.

> *Ryan Reynolds* again for his *method acting*
## Movie Sins
Although it is commendable, there is still issues that I found in the movie.
1. Needs more CGI for quality madness.
2. Needs more British Villains.
3. Needs more Lighting to Deadpool's forehead to prove he's holy.
> Note: Other than that, everything is actually fine.
